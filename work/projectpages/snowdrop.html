      <h1>Snowdrop and the Seven Nymphs</h1>
      <p>By Hannah Myers.<br>An adaptation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by the 
          Brothers Grimm.<br><br>The story will be performed as a musical play for children 
          and adults. It will be dramatic, comedic and engaging. I have brought the story 
          into the present day and have added a magical feel to it. I am portraying the 
          story with a message to take care of nature as humankind is currently killing off 
          nature at a devastating rate.<br><br>The dwarves are now nymphs and are played by 
          children. Their costumes are each inspired by one type of tree that resonates with 
          their character, for example: Sneezy's costume is inspired by a birch tree with 
          pollen catkins on it that make him sneeze. Snow White's costume is inspired by a 
          snowdrop flower. I am renaming her Snowdrop and she represents nature. The evil 
          Queen is renamed Machine Queen and she represents the industrial aspects of 
          humankind and all of the pollution and devastation that humans have caused to 
          nature.<br><br>The Machine Queen disguises herself as an old witch in order to 
          fool Snowdrop into eating a poisoned vegan sausage (because that is possibly the 
          most manmade food there is and it is a fun idea!) Will Snowdrop fall for the Queen
          's trickery this time round? Or will nature rise above the poisons of humankind's 
          existence once and for all…?</p>
