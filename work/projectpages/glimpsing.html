    <h1>'Glimpsing Air Pockets' by Christina Liddell</h1>
    <img class="photo" src="../../resources/images/work.collaboration/glimpsing.avif">
    <p>Glimpsing Air Pockets is an interactive dance performance that Christina wove 
        together to honour the young people at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children 
        in Edinburgh. During the performance the audience are invited to explore the 
        magical set where they can find interactive toadstool mushrooms, fish swimming 
        in a light-projected pond, hempseed maracas to play with and little felt bees 
        and other beasties in amongst the set pieces.<br><br>
        It was such a joy to construct the set pieces from as much reused and naturally-
        regenerative materials as possible! We also had living plants in the set which 
        gave a uniquely organic, intimate feel to the performance. The children from the 
        hospital made woven 'wishes' and, during the show, the audience were invited to 
        hang the wishes on the trees that we had woven out of willow.<br><br>
        During the performance, Christina invited a young girl from the hospital to do a 
        short dance duet with her. This lovely detail tied the whole piece together. It 
        was a truly beautiful and heartfelt performance that touched the hearts of many 
        and shone a light on the remarkable young kids at the Royal Hospital for Sick 
        Children.<br><br>
