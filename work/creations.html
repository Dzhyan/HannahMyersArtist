            <p class="description">I made these rust-inspired textiles out of paper and fabric scraps whilst on the Bridge House Art Portfolio Course in Ullapool. 
            I was inspired by rusty boats and old doors where the paint starts to peel off.</p>

            <p class="description">Hannah designed and constructed these costumes in her final year of 
                studying Performance Costume BA (Hons). The ECA Costume Show 2020 was cancelled due to 
                the pandemic so Hannah decided to make a video of her costumes in her local forest as an 
                alternative way to show them. Click here to watch the video.
                Also click here for Hannah's graduate display in the ECA Online Degree Show 2020 where 
                you can find more images and information about the project.                
                The inspiration for the costumes was a book that Hannah wrote called 'Journey'. In the 
                format of a continuous poem, the book tells the story of Hannah walking barefoot through 
                her forest at home. She describes all of the sensations that she experienced: scents, 
                sights, sounds and the different textures felt under her feet; some nice, some painful. 
                During her walk, she also found objects, plants or animals that she took close-up 
                photographs of and had wonderful imaginings of a miniature human interacting with these 
                things. She created these imaginings visually in photographic form and they appear in the 
                book at the points where they were spotted along the journey. With each image there is a 
                short poem that she wrote to tell a taster of a story about the miniature person's 
                experience. The costumes were inspired by the natural textures found in each photograph. 
                The pages of the book are the paper gills of a mushroom. She created this mushroom 
                structure in order to present the book as a natural form; in homage to the forest (see 
                images below).</p>

            <caption style="caption-side:bottom">Snowdrop and the Seven Nymphs </caption>
            <p class="description">An adaptation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by the Brothers 
                Grimm.
                The story will be performed as a musical play for children and adults. It will be 
                dramatic, comedic and engaging. I have brought the story into the present day and have 
                added a magical feel to it. I am portraying the story with a message to take care of 
                nature as humankind is currently killing off nature at a devastating rate.                
                The dwarves are now nymphs and are played by children. Their costumes are each inspired 
                by one type of tree that resonates with their character, for example: Sneezy's costume 
                is inspired by a birch tree with pollen catkins on it that make him sneeze. Snow White's 
                costume is inspired by a snowdrop flower. I am renaming her Snowdrop and she represents 
                nature. The evil Queen is renamed Machine Queen and she represents the industrial aspects 
                of humankind and all of the pollution and devastation that humans have caused to nature. 
                
                The Machine Queen disguises herself as an old witch in order to fool Snowdrop into eating 
                a poisoned vegan sausage (because that is possibly the most manmade food there is and it 
                is a fun idea!) Will Snowdrop fall for the Queen's trickery this time round? Or will 
                nature rise above the poisons of humankind's existence once and for all…?</p>
